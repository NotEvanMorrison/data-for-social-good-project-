# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

**As an** animal shelter employee **I want to** create an array to identify the most popular dog breed **so that we can** better advertise less popular breeds to find them homes.


## Dataset 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-pet-adoption-status-dataset 
- **Breed** (String) - What the breed of the dog is
- **AgeMonths** (int) - Number of months old a dog is 
- **Size** (String) - What the size of the dog is

## Description 

Our project is a demonstration of our understanding of **traversing** the different **elements** in **1D-Arrays** using different **algoritms**. In this project we have taken on the role of becoming animal shelter employees hoping to retrieve **data** from a **data table** with the goal of not leaving a single dog behind. This is because it can show trends of which dogs are picked most, least, and which dog could be perfect for you! Using **for-loops** and **enhanced for loops** we can traverse through the different **arrays** in order to find our three different picked dogs.
